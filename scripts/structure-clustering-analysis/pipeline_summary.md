# Zn(Cys)₄ Structure Clustering Pipeline — Master Summary

> See `cheatsheet.md` for quick-start commands.

---

## 1. Goal

Cluster ~3000 DFT-relaxed Zn(Cys)₄ structures so that structures likely to produce similar EXAFS
spectra are grouped together. Clusters are then sampled to build an ML training dataset with an even
distribution of structurally distinct configurations, avoiding overrepresentation of near-duplicates.

Each structure has **13 heavy atoms**: Zn + 4 × (S, Cβ, Cα). Each Cys arm terminates at Cα, which is
fixed as the DFT boundary. Hydrogens are excluded throughout.

**Physical sensitivity hierarchy** (what drives spectral variation):
1. Zn–S distances — first-shell single scattering, dominant EXAFS signal
2. S–S distances and Zn–S–S angles — second-shell multiple scattering, tetrahedral distortion
3. Zn–Cβ, Zn–Cα — outer-shell contributions
4. Inter-residue cross-distances (S–Cα) — relative residue orientation

Key EXAFS physics note: even identical Zn–S distances can produce different spectra if the angular
geometry differs (e.g., "3+1" vs. ideal tetrahedral). Multiple-scattering sensitivity to angles is
established in Rehr & Albers (2000) and Trigub et al. (2014).

**Chirality:** EXAFS is achiral — a structure and its mirror image produce the same spectrum.
Enantiomers are merged everywhere (RMSD allows reflection; featurizations use chirality-insensitive
encodings). This is a deliberate design choice, not a limitation.

## 2. The Two Core Symmetry Problems

Every featurization approach must address these before clustering produces meaningful results.

### Problem 1: Coordinate Frame

Structures from different DFT runs arrive in arbitrary lab-frame XYZ. Two physically identical
structures can have completely different coordinate arrays if one is rotated or translated.

**The near-tetrahedral complication:** Ideal T_d symmetry has λ₁ = λ₂ = λ₃ for the inertia tensor
(proportional to identity). For nearly-tetrahedral Zn(Cys)₄, eigenvalues are close but not exactly
equal, making principal-axis alignment numerically unstable — small structural perturbations can
cause large eigenvector rotations. This rules out inertia-tensor-based alignment.

### Problem 2: Residue Ordering

Four chemically equivalent Cys residues can be listed in any order across input files. Even after
perfect rotational alignment, inconsistent listing order scrambles feature vectors.

**Why Zn–S distance sort fails:** All four Zn–S bonds are typically within ~0.05–0.1 Å of each
other — near-ties are the norm. A sort-based canonical order can pair wrong sulfurs between otherwise
identical structures, inflating RMSD by up to an S–S distance. This was the weak point of earlier
pipeline versions and is why the current pipeline uses a 24-permutation joint solve.

**Why 12-atom scaffold (S + Cβ + Cα) rather than 4 S atoms alone:** The four S atoms form an
approximately regular tetrahedron around Zn, which has 12 rotational symmetries — up to 12 of the
24 permutations yield near-identical RMSD values when aligning S only, making the choice arbitrary.
Including Cβ and Cα breaks this symmetry: the Cα–Cβ–S vector points in a unique direction for each
residue, giving each Cys a geometric fingerprint that makes the correct permutation unambiguous.

- Removes loose/orphan H atoms
- Removes atoms from non-coordinated residues
- Enforces exact H counts on capped residues (CA: 3H, CB: 2H)

### `utils.py`

Shared library, not a standalone script. Key exports:

- `Structure` dataclass — `id`, `zn (3,)`, `s/cb/ca (4,3)`. Residue index r: `s[r]`, `cb[r]`, `ca[r]` all belong to the same residue.
- `parse_structure(path)` — reads XYZ using `ATOM=` EOL tags (authoritative; connectivity not used)
- `write_structure_xyz(structure, path)` — writes 13-atom XYZ
- `weighted_kabsch(P, Q, w, allow_reflection)` — SVD-based Kabsch superposition with optional reflection
- `structural_rmsd(A, B, w_type, allow_reflection)` — matching-minimized RMSD over all 24 residue permutations (see §5)
- `cluster_pipeline(X, k, ...)` — z-score with variance floor → PCA 95% → k-means
- `evaluate_clustering(structures, labels, ...)` — computes inter/intra RMSD ratio + CH-analogue score
- `sweep_k(structures, X, k_values, ...)` — k sweep; best result selected by max `ch_score`
- `save_outputs(out_dir, id_list, k_sweep_table, best)` — writes standard CSVs

### `02_approach1_cartesian.py`

Implements Approach 1 (Aligned Cartesian):
- Parses XYZ using `ATOM=` tags
- Runs fixed-point R₀ iteration: align all structures to current R₀ (joint 24-permutation search), recompute R₀ as dataset PCA medoid, repeat until convergence
- Features: 39-D flattened aligned Cartesian `[Zn | S0..3 | Cb0..3 | Ca0..3]`
- Writes aligned XYZ to `aligned_xyz/` (consumed by Approach 2)

### `03_approach2_zmatrix.py`

Implements Approach 2 (Z-matrix):
- Reads aligned XYZ from Approach 1 (`--aligned-xyz-dir`) or raw XYZ and recomputes R₀
- Z-matrix via chemcoord; one construction table built from R₀, reused for all structures (mandatory for column consistency — see §6)
- Features: bond lengths r (raw Å), bond angles θ (raw °), cos(φ) for dihedrals (chirality-insensitive)
- Requires `uv add chemcoord`

### `04_approach3_piv.py`

Implements Approach 3 (PIV):
- Fully independent of R₀; reads raw XYZ
- 78-D PIV: sorted pairwise distances in 9 atom-pair-type blocks
- Near-constant covalent-bond columns handled by variance floor in z-scoring (not explicit exclusion)

### `05_validate_clusters.py`

**Single approach** (`--approach-dir`):
- k-sweep ratio curve + CH-analogue score plot
- Cluster sizes bar chart
- Per-cluster RMSD scatter (requires `--xyz-dir`)
- RMSD table CSV
- PCA→XYZ reconstruction (`--approach1` flag; Approach 1 only — Cartesian features map directly to atom motions)

**Cross-approach comparison** (`--compare-dirs`):
- Reads `k_sweep.csv` from each approach directory
- Comparison table CSV + bar chart of inter/intra ratios

---

## 5. Shared Evaluation Metric

All three approaches use the same RMSD-based metrics, making the comparison fair.

### Structural RMSD (the distance function)

`structural_rmsd(A, B)` — minimum best-fit RMSD over all **4! = 24** residue matchings (Zn fixed;
atoms within a residue never permuted), with reflection allowed. Cost per pair: 24×2 tiny 3×3 SVDs.

**Why not shortcut to a canonical ordering here:** even after the featurization-level ordering, the
four Zn–S distances are near-degenerate, so a sort-based canonical order can pair wrong sulfurs,
inflating RMSD by up to an S–S distance. The 24-permutation enumeration makes the metric exact and
independent of any approach's ordering — required for a fair cross-approach comparison.

**Atom weights (`--weight-scheme`):** Three presets are available, selected via `--weight-scheme`:

| Scheme | Description |
|---|---|
| `distance` (default) | weight = 1 / avg_Zn_distance per atom pair — atoms closer to Zn are weighted higher; Zn itself gets weight 1. |
| `equal` | all atoms weighted uniformly (Zn=S=Cβ=Cα=1). |
| `shell` | S=1, Cβ=0.5, Cα=0.5 — shell-distance proxy without actual geometry. |

For `distance` weighting, each atom slot's weight is computed per structure pair *and* per residue permutation: D = (dist(A_atom, A.Zn) + dist(B_atom_perm, B.Zn)) / 2, weight = 1/D. Since permuting B's residues changes which atoms occupy each slot, weights are recomputed for each of the 24 permutations. Atoms close to Zn (S at ~2 Å) get the highest weight; Cα at ~4 Å gets the lowest.

### Medoid, Intra, Inter

- **Medoid:** member nearest the cluster centroid in PCA space (not the raw coordinate centroid)
- **Intra:** mean `structural_rmsd(medoid, member)` per cluster, then unweighted arithmetic mean across clusters
- **Inter:** mean `structural_rmsd(medoid_i, medoid_j)` over all medoid pairs
- **Ratio:** `inter / intra` (higher = better)

### Calinski–Harabasz Analogue Score (primary k-selection metric)

Raw `inter/intra` increases monotonically with k because intra shrinks as clusters get smaller,
regardless of cluster quality. The CH-analogue normalizes for this:

```
ch_score = (inter² / (k − 1)) / (intra² / (N − k))
```

A high score means clusters are simultaneously well-separated (large inter) and compact (small intra)
relative to what k alone predicts. The score peaks at a genuinely good k rather than simply at the
maximum tested k. The raw ratio is still recorded in `k_sweep.csv` for reference.

### k grid

`k ∈ {10, 12, 14, …, 40}` (step 2, coarse sweep). Each approach selects its own optimal k.

## 6. The Three Featurization Approaches

### Approach 1 — Aligned Cartesian

**Features:** 39-D flattened Cartesian coordinates `[Zn | S0..3 | Cβ0..3 | Cα0..3]` after alignment
to a global reference R₀.

**How R₀ is established (fixed-point iteration):**
1. Initialize R₀ as any structure.
2. `align_to_reference`: for each of the 24 residue permutations π of each structure B, compute
   weighted Kabsch onto R₀ and record RMSD. Keep (π\*, R\*, t\*) with minimum RMSD. Apply the
   winning transform — if a reflection wins, it is applied (collapses enantiomers onto R₀'s handedness).
3. Z-score → PCA 95% on the aligned 39-vectors.
4. Set R₀ ← the structure nearest the PCA-space centroid (the dataset medoid).
5. Stop when R₀ is unchanged **and** < 0.5% of structures change their matching. Cap at 10 iterations.

**Why iterate rather than one-shot:** R₀ shifts as alignment improves — the PCA space and its medoid
change each iteration. Typically converges in 2–5 iterations.

**Why joint rotation+matching enumeration rather than rotate-then-match:** Kabsch needs a correspondence
to produce a rotation; they are mutually dependent. With only 24 matchings the exact joint optimum is
found by trying all of them. ICP-style alternation (rotate from a guess, assign nearest, re-rotate)
risks local minima and is unnecessary at n=4.

**DoF diagnostic:** log PCA component count at 95%; expect ~25. Substantially more indicates labeling
scrambling (35 = 3×13 − 6 internal DoF; minus ~8 near-constant covalent bonds ≈ 25 variable DoF).

**Pros/cons:**

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Invertible — PCA components map directly to atom positions |
| ✅ | Compact (39-D) |
| ✅ | Global R₀ is data-derived, not external |
| ✅ | Joint matching robust to near-tetrahedral Zn–S degeneracy |
| ✅ | Reflection applied — enantiomers merged |
| ⚠️ | Fixed-point iteration (small overhead) |
| ⚠️ | Features are relative to R₀; different datasets produce different R₀ |

---

### Approach 2 — Z-Matrix (Internal Coordinates)

**Features:** Bond lengths r (Å, raw), bond angles θ (°, raw), and cos(φ) for dihedrals — using
chemcoord's Z-matrix representation with a single construction table built from R₀.

**Procedure:**
1. Reorder each structure's residues by the global R₀ labeling from Approach 1.
2. Build a single `construction_table` once from R₀ (`chemcoord.Cartesian.get_zmat()`). Reuse the same
   table for every structure — this is mandatory. chemcoord can infer different connectivity tables
   per structure, breaking column correspondence.
3. Extract r, θ, and cos(φ) per atom.

**Why cos(φ) only for dihedrals:** `cos` is even — invariant under φ → −φ (reflection). Dropping
`sin(φ)` deliberately discards handedness, merging enantiomers as required.

**Dependency on Approach 1:** needs only the global residue labeling, not the rotational alignment.
Internal coordinates are rotation/translation invariant by construction. If chemcoord is not installed,
Approach 2 is silently skipped.

**Pros/cons:**

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Rotation/translation invariant by construction |
| ✅ | Directly encodes bonds, angles, dihedrals — physically interpretable |
| ✅ | cos(φ) encoding merges enantiomers |
| ⚠️ | Requires `chemcoord` |
| ⚠️ | Construction table must be built once from R₀ and reused |

---

### Approach 3 — Permutation Invariant Vector (PIV)

**Features:** 78-D vector of all pairwise Euclidean distances, grouped into 9 atom-pair-type blocks
and sorted ascending within each block.

| Block | Count |
|---|---|
| Zn–S | 4 |
| Zn–Cβ | 4 |
| Zn–Cα | 4 |
| S–S | 6 |
| S–Cβ | 16 |
| S–Cα | 16 |
| Cβ–Cβ | 6 |
| Cβ–Cα | 16 |
| Cα–Cα | 6 |

**Key decisions:**
- **Block partitioning** by atom-pair type (not a single global sort) — preserves physical structure.
- **Raw distances**, no switching function — z-scoring handles dynamic range; switching functions
  saturate large distances and harm reconstruction.
- **Retain covalent-bond distances** in the full 78-vector — needed for reconstruction.
- **Near-constant covalent-bond columns** (S–Cβ ≈ 1.82 Å, Cβ–Cα ≈ 1.52 Å, sub-0.01 Å variation):
  handled by variance floor (std clamped to ≥ 1e-3 Å) in z-scoring, not explicit exclusion.
  Explicitly excluding them would break the reconstruction; the floor is the minimal intervention.
- **Fully independent of R₀** — no reference structure, no residue ordering needed.

**Angular information** is encoded implicitly via cross-distances (S–Cα, S–S capture the tetrahedral
geometry; different S–S patterns diagnose geometry type):

| Geometry | S–S pattern |
|---|---|
| Ideal tetrahedral | All 6 equal (~3.8 Å) |
| 3+1 (one outlier S) | 3 short + 3 long |
| Square planar | 4 short + 2 long |
| Irregular | All 6 different |

**Reconstruction (optional):** PIV sorting destroys per-atom labels, so back-conversion requires
re-deriving atom types via chemistry (covalent bond lengths anchor the assignment), assembling a
candidate distance matrix, and running classical MDS. ~80% useful, not required — medoid structures
can always be visualized directly since cluster membership is tracked by structure ID.

**Pros/cons:**

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Fully invariant to rotation, translation, residue permutation by construction |
| ✅ | No reference structure needed |
| ✅ | Numerically stable — no eigenvalue degeneracy |
| ✅ | Preserves all geometric information except chirality |
| ⚠️ | 78-D (PCA reduces this in practice) |
| ⚠️ | PCA components cannot be mapped directly back to atom positions |
| ⚠️ | Reconstruction requires a dedicated inverse routine |

---

### Approach 4 — SOAP/ACE (Deprioritized)

Systematic spherical-harmonic × radial-basis expansion. Mathematically guaranteed invariance.
Deprioritized for this system: (a) high capability relative to a small fixed-topology 13-atom system;
(b) not invertible; (c) requires additional hyperparameter tuning.

| Resolves residue ordering | ✅ (joint matching to R₀) | ✅ (via R₀ labeling) | ✅ (by construction) |

## 8. Shared Pipeline Details

### XYZ file format

Input files must have `ATOM=` tags in end-of-line comments:
```
ZN   0.000  0.000  0.000  # ATOM=ZN ...
S   -1.918  1.153 -1.048  # ATOM=SG ...
C   -2.604  1.790  0.524  # ATOM=CB ...
C   -3.887  2.627  0.400  # ATOM=CA ...
```
Tags `ATOM=ZN`, `ATOM=SG` (or `S`), `ATOM=CB`, `ATOM=CA` are authoritative. Hydrogen atoms (any
other tag) are ignored. Connectivity is not inferred from geometry except in PIV reconstruction.

### Clustering pipeline (all approaches)

1. **Z-score** each column. Variance floor: `std = max(std, 1e-3 Å)` — avoids amplifying noise in
   near-constant covalent-bond columns.
2. **PCA**, retain 95% cumulative variance. Expected ~25 components (see DoF diagnostic).
3. **k-means** in PCA space: fixed `random_state=0`, `n_init ≥ 10`.

### Output directory layout

```

### Degrees of freedom reference

- 3 × 13 = 39 Cartesian DoF
- −3 translations, −3 rotations → **33 internal DoF**
- −8 near-constant covalent bonds (S–Cβ and Cβ–Cα × 4 residues) → **~25 variable DoF**
- PCA at 95% is expected to retain ~25 components. Substantially more → labeling scrambled.

### Logging and terminal output

- Terminal text is fine before/after a progress bar — never during one (no per-line prints inside
  active tqdm loops; use `tqdm.write(...)` if something must surface mid-loop).
- Per-item warnings are collected and summarized after the bar, not streamed per structure.
- Detailed status goes to a log file (Python `logging` with `FileHandler`; no console `StreamHandler`
  inside loops). One readable text log + machine-parseable JSONL mirror.
- R₀ convergence trace format per iteration:
  ```
  iter=01  R0=struct_0427  matching_changed= 312/3000 (10.40%)  refl_flipped= 88  pca_dims=27  centroid_shift=0.0421
  iter=02  R0=struct_0613  matching_changed=  41/3000 ( 1.37%)  refl_flipped= 11  pca_dims=25  centroid_shift=0.0068
  iter=03  R0=struct_0613  matching_changed=   9/3000 ( 0.30%)  refl_flipped=  2  pca_dims=25  centroid_shift=0.0011  [CONVERGED]
  ```

## 10. Tests and Validation

1. **Invariance unit tests** — for each featurization, assert feature vector is unchanged under:
   random rotation, translation, residue relabeling, and reflection (for A3 and the metric; A1/A2
   after their chirality-insensitive encodings).
2. **Identity RMSD** — `structural_rmsd(A, A) ≈ 0`; `structural_rmsd(A, rotate(A)) ≈ 0`;
   `structural_rmsd(A, mirror(A)) ≈ 0`; and `structural_rmsd` of two relabeled-but-identical
   structures ≈ 0 (guards the residue-ordering degeneracy bug).
3. **DoF diagnostic** — PCA component count at 95% logged each R₀ iteration; expect ~25.
4. **Reconstruction (A3, if built)** — round-trip `piv_reconstruct(approach3_piv(s))` on known
   structures; report reconstruction RMSD.
5. **Determinism** — fixed seeds reproduce labels.

---

## 11. Dependencies

`numpy`, `scipy` (SVD, eigh), `scikit-learn` (PCA, KMeans), `chemcoord` (Approach 2 only; silently
skipped if absent), `tqdm` (progress bars). Standard library `logging` for file-based logging.
No GPU required; full run is CPU-bound and tractable for N ≈ 3000.
